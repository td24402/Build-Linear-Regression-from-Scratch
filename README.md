# Build-Linear-Regression-from-Scratch

This project demonstrates how to build a linear regression model from scratch—without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn. It uses the SOCR Height and Weight Dataset and explores two different methods:

    1. Least Squares (Analytical)

    2. Gradient Descent (Iterative)

# Project Goals

Understand the math behind linear regression

Implement linear regression without scikit-learn

Visualize the best-fit line and model convergence

Compare performance between analytical and iterative methods

Learn about standardization and MSE conversion

# Key Learnings 

Standardization is critical for gradient-based optimization

Analytical and iterative methods can both reach the global minimum for simple linear regression

Visualizations (scatter + regression line) help verify fit

Converting MSE back to the original scale is important for interpretation

# Conclusion 

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of linear regression through both a mathematical and programmatic lens. Building from scratch reinforces core concepts, such as slope, intercept, gradient computation, standardization, and convergence—making it an excellent learning experience.
